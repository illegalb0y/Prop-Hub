Admins currently manage Projects, Banks, and Developers via separate sections in the admin panel. As data grows, admins need faster ways to locate objects and perform actions on multiple objects at once. This PRD adds:

Multi-select in list views to enable bulk Delete and bulk Restore
Sorting + filtering within each section to quickly find specific objects for admin actions
2. Goals
Enable admins to select multiple objects in list view and perform bulk actions:
Delete (soft-delete) for active objects
Restore for deleted objects
Provide consistent sorting and filtering controls across Projects/Banks/Developers
Reduce time-to-find and time-to-act on objects in large lists
Minimize accidental destructive actions via clear UI and confirmation steps
3. Non-goals
Introducing new object types or changing data models beyond what’s necessary for list operations
Implementing complex advanced search (full-text across all fields) unless explicitly included in requirements
Bulk editing fields (other than delete/restore)
Changing existing permission model (except enforcing it for these actions)
4. Users & Use Cases
Primary user
Admin / Moderator with permissions to view and manage Projects/Banks/Developers.
Key use cases
Select 10 projects and delete them after a moderation sweep
Filter developers by status “Pending” and restore multiple previously deleted entries
Sort banks by updated date to find recently modified items
Filter projects by name or ID to quickly open and review a single item
5. Assumptions / Dependencies
“Delete” is soft delete (object can be restored). If hard delete exists, it is out of scope unless specified.
Each object has an identifier and metadata available (e.g., createdAt/updatedAt/status).
Backend supports:
Pagination
Filtering and sorting parameters
Bulk action endpoints (or can be added)
Permission checks exist server-side for delete/restore actions.
6. UX Requirements
6.1 List View: Multi-select
Applies to list pages in:

Admin → Projects
Admin → Banks
Admin → Developers
UI components

A checkbox in the table header for Select all on current page
A checkbox on each row to select that row
A bulk action toolbar appears when ≥ 1 item is selected:
Shows count: “Selected: N”
Buttons: Delete and/or Restore (contextual)
“Clear selection” action
Selection behavior

Selecting header checkbox selects all visible rows on the current page.
Selection persists when:
Applying sorting/filtering: selection should be cleared by default to avoid acting on unintended sets (recommended).
Alternative (optional): keep selection but show warning “Filters changed; selection updated.” (requires more complexity)
Navigating pagination: selection cleared by default (simpler, safer).
Bulk actions availability

If viewing “Active” list: show Delete.
If viewing “Deleted/Archived” list: show Restore.
If list mixes active and deleted items (not recommended), bulk action buttons should be enabled only if the selection is homogeneous or the system supports applying correct action per item; otherwise show validation message.
Confirmation

Bulk Delete: modal confirmation:
Title: “Delete N items?”
Copy: “Deleted items can be restored.”
Actions: Cancel / Delete
Bulk Restore: modal confirmation:
Title: “Restore N items?”
Copy: “Restored items will become active.”
Actions: Cancel / Restore
Results and feedback

After action completes:
Show toast: “Deleted N items” / “Restored N items”
Refresh list data
Clear selection
Partial success handling:
Toast: “Deleted X of N items”
Provide a details expandable section or downloadable error list (at minimum show which IDs failed and why).
6.2 Sorting & Filtering
Each section gets a Filter bar above the list and sortable columns.

Common filters (all sections)
Status (Active / Deleted)
Default: Active
Search input (single field)
Matches: Name + ID (exact or partial)
Behavior: Debounced input (300–500ms) or explicit “Search” button (choose one and keep consistent)
Sorting (common)
Sortable fields (minimum):
Created date (createdAt)
Updated date (updatedAt)
Name (alphabetical)
Default sort:
updatedAt desc (recommended) or current behavior if already established
Section-specific filters (recommended if fields exist)
Projects
Developer (dropdown / autocomplete)
Bank (dropdown / autocomplete)
Country/Region (if applicable)
Banks
Country/Region
Bank code (if exists)
Developers
Verification/KYC status (if exists)
Country/Region
Filter UX

Filters should be combinable (AND logic).
“Clear filters” button resets to defaults.
Filters + sort should be reflected in the URL query string for shareable/admin-friendly links.
7. Functional Requirements (Detailed)
7.1 Backend/API
List endpoints must accept:

page, pageSize
sortBy (enum), sortOrder (asc/desc)
status (active/deleted)
q (search term)
Optional section-specific params (e.g., developerId, bankId, country)
Bulk actions

POST /admin/projects/bulk-delete body: { ids: [...] }
POST /admin/projects/bulk-restore body: { ids: [...] } (Similar for banks/developers)
Response should include:

succeededIds
failed: [{ id, reasonCode, message }]
7.2 Permissions & Security
Only authorized roles can perform delete/restore.
Server must enforce access regardless of UI state.
Rate limiting / max bulk size:
Define max IDs per request (e.g., 100) to protect system; if selection exceeds, UI should batch or warn.
8. Edge Cases
Item already deleted when bulk delete is applied → return failed with reason “ALREADY_DELETED” or treat idempotently.
Item cannot be restored due to constraints (e.g., missing dependencies) → show per-item failure.
Pagination changes due to filters after action → list refresh should land on a valid page.
Very large datasets:
Ensure query performance with indexes on searchable/sortable fields (id, name, status, createdAt, updatedAt).
9. Metrics / Success Criteria
Reduction in median time to locate an object (proxy: fewer page navigations, faster completion)
Number of bulk actions performed per week (adoption)
Error rate for bulk actions (should be low; track partial failures)
Admin satisfaction feedback (qualitative)
10. QA / Acceptance Criteria
Multi-select
 Each section shows row checkboxes and header “select all on page”
 Bulk action bar appears when ≥ 1 selected
 Bulk delete works for active items; bulk restore works for deleted items
 Confirmation modal appears; cancel does nothing
 After completion, list refreshes and selection clears
 Partial success is communicated with details
Sorting & Filtering
 Filters apply correctly and can be combined
 Sorting toggles asc/desc and persists in URL
 “Clear filters” resets to default state
 Search works for ID and name and is consistent across sections
 Performance: list loads within acceptable time under expected data volume (define target, e.g., p95 < 1.5s)
